# Data Analysis with Pythonâœ¨

Data analysis is the process of cleaning, changing, and processing raw data and extracting actionable, relevant information that helps businesses make informed decisions. The procedure helps reduce the risks inherent in decision-making by providing useful insights and statistics, often presented in charts, images, tables, and graphs.

## ðŸ“„ Summary

Analyzing data with Python is an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. 
This course teaches the basics of data analysis with Python to building and evaluating data models, how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. Then predicting future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and learn how to evaluate them. 

Topics covered include:  
- collecting and importing data 
- cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
- data frame manipulation 
- summarizing data 
- building machine learning regression models 
- model refinement 
- creating data pipelines
