## Introduction to Machine Learning‚ú®

Machine learning (ML) is the practice of teaching a computer to learn and it is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. 
The main focus of ML is to allow "computer systems learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention".

#### The difference between Artificial Intilligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

‚ÄúWhat is the difference between these buzzwords that we keep hearing these days, such as Artificial intelligence (or AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning?‚Äù

- AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans. 
So, Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization. 

- Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence.It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations. 

- Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. 

#### Applications of Machine learning

- It is used heavily in the self-driving car industry to classify objects that a car might encounter while driving, for example, people, traffic signs, and other cars.
- Many cloud computer service providers like IBM and Amazon use machine learning to protect their services.
- It is used to detect and prevent attacks like a distributed denial-of-service attack or suspicious and malicious usage. 
- It is used to find trends and patterns in stock data that can help decide which stocks to trade or which prices to buy and sell at.
- It is to help identify cancer in patients. Using an x-ray scan of the target area, machine learning can help detect any potential tumors.

### Python for Machine Learning

Python is a programming language that distinguishes itself from other programming languages by its flexibility, simplicity, and 
reliable tools required to create modern software. 
It is simple to read but also powerful enough that it can do a lot of things, which makes it most appropriate for machine learning.

##### Python packages used in this course 

- NumPy which is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python
- SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
- Matplotlib is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.
- Pandas library is a very high-level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures. It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis.
- SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning which is our focus here and which you'll learn to use within this course.

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning
##### Supervised learning deals with 

- Classification 
- Classifies labelled data
- Regression: Predicts trends using previous labelled data
- Has more evaluation method than Unsupervised Learning
- Controlled environment

##### Unsupervised learning deals with 

- Clustering. 
- Find patterns and groupings from unlabeled data
- Has fewer evaluation method than supervised Learning
- Less controlled environment
