### Introduction to Classification

Machine learning classification is a supervised learning approach which can be thought of as a means of categorizing or classifying some unknown items into a discrete set of classes. 

#### K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a classification algorithm that takes a bunch of labeled points and uses them to learn how to label other points. This algorithm classifies cases based on their similarity to other cases. In K-Nearest Neighbors, data points that are near each other are said to be neighbors. K-Nearest Neighbors is based on this paradigm. Similar cases with the same class labels are near each other. Thus, the distance between two cases is a measure of their dissimilarity.

### Evaluation Metrics in Classification

There are different model evaluation metrics but we just talk about three of them here, specifically: Jaccard index, F1-score, and Log Loss. 

#### Lab: KNN

In this Lab you will load a customer dataset related to a telecommunication company, clean it, use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of your model.

## Decision Trees

#### Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision trees are about testing an attribute and branching the cases based on the result of the test. 
Each internal node corresponds to a test, and each branch corresponds to a result of the test, and each leaf node assigns a patient to a class. 

#### Lab: Decision Trees

In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications. 
Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

#### Lab: Faster Credit Card Fraud Detection using Snap ML

In this lab,  you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. For this lab you will be using the Snap ML library that can accelerate popular Machine Learning algorithms through system awareness, and hardware/software differentiation.
